# Hello, I'm Naresh Thakur

I'm an AI Architect with 16+ years of engineering experience — now fully immersed in the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Generative AI**, **Agentic AI**, and **MLOps**.

This GitHub is where I document my experiments, share projects, and explore ideas across complete AI lifecycle:

🧠 **Problem Framing** → 📥 **Data Collection** → 🧹 **Data Processing** → 🧪 **Model Development** → 📊 **Evaluation** → 📦 **Versioning** → 🚀 **Deployment** → 📉 **Monitoring** → 🔁 **Retraining**

<!--
- 🤖 **Large Language Models (LLMs)** – fine-tuning, evaluation, prompt engineering
- 🕹️ **Agentic AI** – multi-agent orchestration, tool integration, reasoning workflows
- 🛠️ **MLOps** – versioning, monitoring, CI/CD, retraining loops using MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes
- ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure** – AWS (EC2, Lambda, SageMaker), Terraform, GitHub Actions
- 📚 **Vector Search & Retrieval** – FAISS, Pinecone, Elastic, MongoDB
-->
My focus is not just on research — but on **execution**. I believe great AI should be **useful, reliable, and production-ready**.

If you're working on anything exciting in this space — or just want to talk AI, systems, or engineering leadership — feel free to connect.

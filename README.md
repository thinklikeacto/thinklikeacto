# Hello, I'm Naresh Thakur

I'm an AI Architect with 16+ years of engineering experience — now fully immersed in the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Generative AI**, **Agentic AI**, and **MLOps**.

This space is a reflection of my personal learning journey and exploration. You'll find projects where I:
- fine-tune and deploy Large Language Models (LLMs),
- build agentic systems that simulate decision-making and reasoning,
- experiment with scalable MLOps pipelines using modern tools, and
- reimagine how AI can be turned into reliable, real-world solutions.

My focus is not just on research — but on **execution**. I believe great AI should be **useful, reliable, and production-ready**.

If you're working on anything exciting in this space — or just want to talk AI, systems, or engineering leadership — feel free to connect.
